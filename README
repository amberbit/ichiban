== Rails 3 (edge) + Mongoid + RSpec + Steak app skeleton

This is initial application with Rails 3, Mongoid, RSpec and Steak.
Clone, run:

    bundle install

and enjoy.

Run tests to check if the app starts properly, and Google still operates (which means there was no nuclear holocaust, which is a good thing):

    rake spec

If 1 test passes, you're done. Start creating your brand new Rails 3 app!

TODO: Make a Rails template from this. (this will never happen).
